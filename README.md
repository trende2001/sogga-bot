# SoggaBot

SoggaBot is a multi-feature bot, what else do I have to say. Very simple, very easy to setup (if you know how)

# Installation

Only thing I could tell you though is to rename `example.config.json` to `config.json`, then to configure the file to your liking

Uses `discord.js` v13.1.0, don't upgrade to v14 unless you are willing to fix the bot with newer versions.

*might add more steps here*

# Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For bugs, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to see changed.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.

You can host this bot personally, but not commercially. You can also learn from it and contribute to make it better.
